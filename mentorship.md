## GRIDS Mentorship

The GRIDS Mentorship program aims to guide and support members at all levels and build community at GRIDS. For those looking to join our expert panel of GRIDS Mentors, this is a great chance to use your expertise to help out others in the Data Science community and have your profile featured on the GRIDS platform. If you are someone who has experience in any of the following (or in a field not indicated below), please sign up to be a mentor!

- Navigating a Career in Data Science
- Interviewing for a Job
- Programming
- Research
- Soft Skills
- Data Science/Computer Science Tools and Technologies

If you are someone who would like to receive mentoring, look no further! Our mentee applications will open up soon and we will contact members in our mailing list.

Mentors will be expected to meet with their mentees at least once a month through Zoom (or any other platform you prefer), and both parties can decide how frequently you may connect through email or Slack. The GRIDS Team will help facilitate a comfortable and safe environment for mentors and mentees to communicate.
