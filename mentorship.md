Mentoring Topics: Interviewing for a Job, Programming, Navigating Graduate School, Data Science/Computer Science Tools and Technologies

*"I'm a 2nd year MSCS student from Malaysia interested in building large, scalable applications. Before this, I did my undergrad in Geophysics at Imperial College London. So, it wasn't too long ago when I did not have any CS background. Since then, I have interned at a big tech company and a hedge fund. I'd love to mentor someone who was in a similar place as me a year ago and help him/her break into tech!"*

*"Hi! In this vast and dynamic landscape of computer science, my interests include all things security and privacy, cryptography, blockchain, full-stack engineering, and the intersection between technology and policy. I've spent much of my time at USC working on security-related projects and research with some web development on the side! Along the way, I've experienced my fair share of interviews (both nightmarish and pleasant), large group projects, and the rewarding feeling of working on directed research. Please don't hesitate to reach out! I'd be more than happy to talk about anything from cool project ideas to navigating the joys and challenges of grad school life! :)"*
