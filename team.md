I’m really interested in using data science to augment the scientific research process and making data science tools and technologies accessible to scientists and professionals. Outside of my studies, I enjoy trying out new vegan recipes, killing my houseplants and buying replacements (it’s a vicious cycle), hiking, and travelling!"*
