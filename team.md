Haripriya Dharmala [[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haripriya-dharmala/)]

*"I've spent the better part of the last few years working on building intelligent systems for various purposes including hypothesis testing in neuroscience, classifying software metadata, detecting signature forgery and generating classical music to name a few.
I'm also interested in using AI to solve challenging problems in Computational Social Science, Art and Natural Language. In my free time, you can find me working on music, reading and going on long walks.
Reach out to me if you want to talk Data Science, graduate school, or music!"*

*"I am passionate in building AI softwares and systems at scale that lead people happier, healthier life in harmony with the environment. I'm currently working in [USC RESL](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/) in a [reinforcement learning opensource project](https://github.com/rlworkgroup/garage). On the fun side, I'm an ultra runner, hiker, and advanced scruba diver - I find that mother nature helps me to balance myself, especially after a long day of working in front of the screen."*

*"Greetings everyone! Data Science and Machine Learning are somewhat of a recent interest of mine, I’ve worked on various different projects ranging from sentiment analysis, music generation and inclusion of facial recognition in social media. My current inclination is towards working on applications of AI and ML in the medical field. Keeping my professional side aside, I enjoy watching basketball and am a huge Lakers fan! I also love movies and rock music."*
