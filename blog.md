![alt-text](/assets/img/resume_workshop/IMG_5586.jpeg "workshop")
This event was designed to help students create a professional and effective resume that highlights their skills and experience. The workshop was led by the graduating masters students with succesful job hunting campaigns! They offer thier insights and tips in attracting the best companies by helping students build thwie resumes form the grsound up!

During the workshop, participants were encouraged to reflect on their own experiences and skills and to brainstorm ways to showcase them in their resumes. They were asked to complete exercises or activities to help them identify their strengths and accomplishments and to develop language to describe them in their resumes.

The facilitators provided feedback on participants' resumes, pointing out areas where they can improve and offering suggestions for how to highlight their strengths and experience more effectively. Participants were typically given time to work on their resumes during the workshop, and the facilitators were available to answer questions and provide additional guidance as needed.

At the end of the workshop, participants had a better understanding of how to create a professional and effective resume that highlights their skills and experience. They were also equipped with the tools and knowledge to continue refining their resumes and adapt them to different job opportunities in the future.

## Graph Neural Networks: From Theory to Practice

![alt-text](/assets/img/GNN_workshop//DSC01648.JPG "GNN talk")

This talk was led by our very own Satwant Singh! Satwant is a final year Applied Data Science student who has extensive research and industry experience in machine learning.

Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning algorithm that are designed to work with graph-structured data.

During the talk, Satwant provided an overview of what Graph Neural Networks are, how they work, and their applications in various fields, such as social network analysis, recommender systems, and drug discovery. He also discussed the challenges of working with graph-structured data and how graph neural networks can help overcome some of these challenges.

He also presented examples of how Graph Neural Networks have been used in real-world applications and provide insights into the advantages and limitations of these models. He also demonstrated how to build and train a graph neural network using pytorch and even had a brief session group session on a google collab notebook!

Overall, this talk on Graph Neural Networks was an opportunity for students and other interested individuals to learn about this exciting area of machine learning and to gain insights into how it can be applied to solve complex problems in various fields.
